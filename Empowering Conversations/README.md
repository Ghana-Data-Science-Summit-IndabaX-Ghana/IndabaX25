# Empowering Conversational AI with Fine-tuned Large Language Models: A hands-on guide

This repository provides structured materials for a hands-on tutorial series on fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for conversational AI applications. It balances theoretical foundations (~60 minutes) with hands-on practical implementations and guided exercises. The workshop covers architectural fundamentals, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, and responsible deployment strategies.

> ü§ñ *The tutorial is divided into three sessions: theoretical foundations, hands-on demonstration, and guided practical exercises.*
