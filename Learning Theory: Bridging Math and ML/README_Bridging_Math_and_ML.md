# Learning Theory: Bridging Math and ML

Machine Learning (ML) has become a buzz word in our day. Many use libraries and AI tools to build ML models without understanding the inner workings of these models its preprocess.
This repository explains the importance of Mathematics, specifically Linear Algebra, in the ML pipeline, providing the fundamentals.

## Key Lessons
- Vectors
- Dot Product
- Basis Vector, Linear Combinations and Vector Spaces
- Matrix Vector Multiplication as Linear Transformations
- Matrix Multiplication Views
- Eigen Vector Decomposition
- Principal Component Analysis
