In recent times, the yearning among Ghanaian youth to seek greener pastures abroad has grown. The allure of Europe or America is undeniable, especially against the backdrop of high unemployment, insufficient infrastructure and limited opportunities for personal growth in our homeland. Yet, while these challenges are real, I am here with a different message: a call for the youth to stay, to rise and to build. The future of Ghana rests on us—and begins with us.
As young people, we are often described as the future of our nation, but the truth is, we are just as vital to the present. If we don't take charge now, who will? Ghana's progress depends on our hands, our voices and our determination to lead the way. Life abroad often sparkles from a distance, but having lived as an immigrant, I can assure you that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Many of us underestimate the value of home until we leave.
My father always used to tell me and those close to him, 'If you go abroad to study, you need to come back to base. Come back to your country, serve and make an impact.' At the time, I didn't fully understand the weight of his words. But now, being far from home, I see the truth in what he meant. Ghana is our home, and the fact that it is struggling on the path to development does not mean we have to abandon it.
Housing in Ghana is also far more affordable than in Europe and the U.S. Rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Ghana averages $150 (GH¢2,334) to $400 (GH¢ 6,224), compared to $1,600+(GHS24,896+) in the U.S. and €900+(GH¢15,814+) in Europe. Ghana offers what many developed nations no longer can: the chance to belong, the freedom to build and the space to thrive. Here, you can own land, launch businesses with fewer hurdles, and live in a society where you are not seen as 'foreign.'
For those of us who move to Western countries, let us not forget our responsibility to our homeland. While abroad, we must act as spectators, observing and learning from the successes and failures of these nations. By studying their systems, policies and innovations, we can gather valuable insights that can be adapted to Ghana's unique context.
As we rise to build our homeland, let us also rise in love, unity and peace. Development cannot thrive where there is division or hatred. We must embrace one another—regardless of tribe, religion, background or belief. Do not lose faith in Ghana. Our nation's future lies within our hands. The Ghana we envision will not be built by outsiders; it will be built by us—the dreamers, the doers and the determined. No matter where life takes you, let your knowledge, skills and passion work for the good of Ghana. Because no matter how far you go, Ghana will always be home.
