Doctor: Agoo. Auntie, come inside, come inside. Sit down, please. What is the problem?

Patient: Doctor, good afternoon. Please, it's my son, Kwaku. Since yesterday evening, he has been visiting the toilet nonstop. And the vomiting... eii, Doctor, I have never seen anything like this.

Doctor: Okay, Maa, calm down. We will figure it out. You say the toilet started yesterday evening. Can you remember what time?

Patient: After our evening meal. Maybe around 7 PM. He just said his stomach was turning him. Then he started running to the toilet. All through the night, Doctor. No sleep.

Doctor: I see. And the vomiting, did it start at the same time?

Patient: Yes, almost the same time. First, it was the food he ate. Now, it's just water. Just plain water coming out.

Doctor: Let's talk about the toilet he is visiting. The stool. What does it look like? Is there any blood in it?

Patient: No, no blood. Doctor, that is the strange thing. It looks like... like the water you use to wash rice. Just whitish and watery. No smell, nothing. Just gushing out like a tap.

Doctor: Like rice water, you say? That is very important. How many times has he gone since last night? Have you been able to count?

Patient: Eii, Doctor, count? I lost count after ten times. It's more, maybe 15 or 20 times. I can't even say. As soon as he drinks small water, it comes right out from his back.

Doctor: Okay. Does he have a fever? Is his body hot?

Patient: (Touches Kwaku's forehead) No, not really. He is not hot. He is just... weak. Look at him. He can't even lift his head. Kwaku? (The boy moans softly).

Doctor: (Leans forward to look at the child) I can see that. Has he been able to drink anything at all? Or he vomits everything?

Patient: He tries. I gave him some of the oral... the salt water a neighbour gave me, but it comes back out. He is thirsty, always asking for water, but his body won't keep it.

Doctor: And has he passed any urine since morning?

Patient: Doctor, now that you mention it... no. I haven't seen him urinate since I woke up this morning. Not even a drop. I'm getting very scared.

Doctor: Okay, Auntie Mercy. It's good you brought him in. Let me ask you, what did he eat yesterday for supper? Before this all started.

Patient: We all ate banku and okro stew at home. But in the afternoon, on his way back from school, he used his pocket money to buy waakye from the woman at the junction.

Doctor: The waakye seller at circle?

Patient: Yes, that one. He loves her food.

Doctor: And your water source at home? What do you drink?

Patient: We buy the sachet water, the "pure water". That is what we all drink.

Doctor: (Stands up and walks over to the mother and child. He gently lifts the child's eyelid.) His eyes are very sunken. (He pinches a fold of skin on the child's abdomen. It stays up for a moment before slowly retracting.) Hmmm. The skin is not going back quickly. He is very, very dry inside. Severely dehydrated.

Patient: Doctor, please, what is it? Is it the waakye? Is it food poisoning?

Doctor: It could be. There are many things that cause serious diarrhoea. It could be a bad bacteria from the food. But the way you describe the stool—like rice water—and the fact that there is no fever, and this severe dehydration... it points me strongly in one direction. I am suspecting Cholera.

Patient: (Gasps) Cholera! Eii, Jesus! Where would my son get that from?

Doctor: We will find out. But right now, we don't have time to waste. He needs water back in his body immediately, but not through his mouth. I am admitting him now. The nurse will put a drip on him, an IV line, to give him fluids directly. While she does that, I need you to do something for me.

Patient: Anything, Doctor.

Doctor: We need a stool sample. The nurse will give you a small container. When he passes stool again, please collect a little for the lab. I am sending a request form now. I want them to look at it under the microscope right away and also to culture it to be sure of the exact bacteria.

Patient: Okay, Doctor. I will do it.

(An hour later. Kwaku is on the ward bed with an IV drip in his arm. Dr. Adjei walks in with a lab report slip.)

Doctor: Auntie Mercy, I have the first result from the lab.

Patient: (Stands up anxiously) What does it say?

Doctor: Just as I suspected. The lab technician said the sample looked exactly like rice water. Under the microscope, he saw a lot of fast-moving, comma-shaped organisms. This is a classic sign. The full culture will take a day or two to confirm, but we cannot wait. We are proceeding with a diagnosis of Cholera.

Patient: Oh, my God. So what will you do? Will he be okay?

Doctor: He is already getting the most important treatment: the IV fluids. See, he is looking a little brighter already. The main danger of cholera is the loss of water and salts, and we are replacing that. We will also give him an antibiotic to kill the bacteria faster. He will be fine, but he needs to stay here for a few days.

Patient: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

Doctor: You are welcome. Now, we must talk about home. Has anyone else in your house or any of Kwaku's friends complained of a running stomach?

Patient: No, not yet.

Doctor: Okay. This is very important. You must all be very careful. Wash your hands with soap and water always—after using the toilet, before cooking, before eating. Boil all your drinking water, even if it's sachet water, just to be safe for now. Cook food thoroughly and eat it while it's hot. And I would advise you to avoid buying food from that junction for a while. This is a public health issue, so we will have to inform the authorities so they can investigate the source. We don't want an outbreak.

Patient: I understand, Doctor. I will do everything you say. Thank you so much.

Doctor: You're welcome, Maa. Your boy is strong. We will take good care of him.
