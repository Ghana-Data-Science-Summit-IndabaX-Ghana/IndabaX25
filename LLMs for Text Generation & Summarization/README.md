# LLMs for Text Generation & Summarization

This repository contains materials for a comprehensive workshop on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation and summarization tasks.

## Overview

The workshop explores modern approaches to text summarization using transformer-based architectures, covering both extractive and abstractive techniques. Participants will gain practical experience implementing multi-stage summarization pipelines and evaluating their quality using various metrics.

## Prerequisites

Before attending the workshop, participants should:
- Have basic knowledge of Python programming
- Be familiar with fundamental NLP concepts
- Complete the pre-reading materials (see [PRE-TUTORIAL.md](PRE-TUTORIAL.md))

## Installation <!-- This might be better as Environment Setup -->

To set up the environment for this workshop:<!-- Mention assumptions or expectations like operating systems, and prior installations (python, venv, pip) -->

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ghana-Data-Science-Summit-IndabaX-Ghana/IndabaX25.git
cd IndabaX25/LLMs-for-Text-Generation-Summarization <!-- Folder name mismatch. You might want to use cd LLMs\ for\ Text\ Generation\ \&\ Summarization -->

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
# Create a .env file with the following:
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Tutorial Outline

The workshop is divided into three main parts:

### Part I: Architectural Overview and Extractive Summarization
- Understanding transformer architecture
- Categories of LLMs (Decoder-only, Encoder-only, Encoder-Decoder)
- Implementing extractive summarization
- Establishing evaluation metrics (ROUGE, BLEU)

### Part II: Abstractive Summarization & Control Parameters
- Implementing BART and T5 models for abstractive summarization
- Comparing with autoregressive models
- Controlling summary generation (length, style, focus)
- Building multi-stage summarization pipelines

### Part III: Advanced Techniques
- Multimodal summarization (text + images)
- Advanced evaluation beyond ROUGE
- Practical exercises for building custom systems

## Key Features <!-- This might be better as Workshop Objectives, and moved up to be the second section just after the Overview -->

- **Multiple Summarization Approaches**: Compare extractive, abstractive, and hybrid techniques <!-- Rephase each of these to highlight expected learning objectives: "You will be able to..." -->
- **Advanced Control Parameters**: Learn to control summary length, style, and focus
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Go beyond ROUGE with factual consistency and semantic similarity
- **Multi-Stage Pipelines**: Combine techniques for more effective summarization
